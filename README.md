A desktop application for mushroom identification using OpenAI's vision models. Built with Go and GTK+ for a native GUI experience with modern Go practices.

## ⚠️ Important Safety Notice

**This tool is for educational purposes only.** Never consume wild mushrooms based solely on this or any app's identification. Always consult with local mycology experts before consuming any wild mushrooms. Misidentification can lead to serious illness or death.

## ✨ Features

- 🖼️ **Image Analysis**: Upload photos of mushrooms for AI-powered identification
- 🧠 **Advanced AI**: Leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision for accurate analysis
- 🎨 **Native GUI**: Clean, intuitive interface built with GTK+ 3
- 📊 **Detailed Results**: Get species names, confidence levels, and safety information
- 🔒 **Secure**: API credentials stored safely in environment files
- 🏗️ **Modern Go Architecture**: Well-structured codebase with idiomatic Go patterns

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or higher
- GTK+ 3.0 development libraries
- OpenAI API key with GPT-4 Vision access

## 🔧 Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your OpenAI credentials:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
OPENAI_API_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
```

## 📖 Usage

1. **Launch the application**
   ```bash
   ./build/mushroom-classifier
   ```

2. **Select an image**
   - Click "Select Image" to choose a mushroom photo
   - Supported formats: JPEG, PNG

3. **Classify the mushroom**
   - Click "Classify Mushroom" to analyze the image
   - Wait for the AI to process and return results

4. **Review the results**
   - Species identification (common and scientific names)
   - Confidence level
   - Key identifying features
   - Edibility status
   - Safety warnings
   - Similar species to be aware of

## 🧪 Testing

### API Connection Test
```bash
make test
```

This will verify your OpenAI API credentials and connection.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The application follows Go best practices with a modular architecture:

- **Config Package**: Handles environment variables and application settings
- **Base64 Package**: Provides image encoding functionality
- **HTTPClient Package**: Manages API communications
- **OpenAI Package**: Interfaces with OpenAI's vision models
- **GUI Package**: Implements the GTK+ user interface
- **Main Package**: Orchestrates the application lifecycle

### Key Design Principles

- **Package-Oriented Design**: Each package has a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error checking with Go's error patterns
- **Concurrency**: Proper use of goroutines for non-blocking UI operations
- **Security**: API keys stored in environment files, never hardcoded
- **Documentation**: Extensive godoc comments throughout
